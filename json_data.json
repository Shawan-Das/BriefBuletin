Many of the articles published cover and extend on pre-existing rumors about their divorce, and speculations of their current relationship since they uploaded a picture of their two-year old son. However, the coverage went just beyond that. From probing into their personal lives, contacting close family members, to solidifying rumors about Shakib's involvement with other female co-stars, the media stopped at nothing to pump out content.\\n\\nThis harms our community in a multitude of ways, the first one being the most obvious one: not doing justice to the right to privacy of these celebrities. It is already difficult for celebrities, wherever they may be from, to keep their lives under the wraps from the public. It's easy for us to forget that they are just like the rest of us, and have the same inalienable rights to privacy and non-disclosure as us.\\n\\nIn this wild goose-chase of Shakib Khan's history and his past and present involvement with co-stars, the personal lives of female artists like Apu Biswas, Puja Chery, and Shabnom Bubly herself were put in jeopardy.\\n\\nAs much as the audience should try to deter from being obsessed with canards and tell-tales, media organisations also have the unique responsibility of protecting the actors involved in the drama, not to mention the children of Shakib Khan as well. This forced limelight that children face due to the lottery of being born to celebrities is absolutely damaging to their childhood. The moral responsibility of sparing them the flashes of the paparazzi rests solely on the shoulders of these newspapers, TV channels and news portals, something that they do not seem to pay heed to.\\n\\nThere exists a fine line between providing news reports on currently sought-after topics and being invasive. And in our information hungry delusions we often don't realise that the line we have crossed is miles behind us.\\n\\nI sympathise with those who have the job of providing coverage on celebrities and their lives, but that sympathy is valid only up to the point where they are not stepping on civil liberties or harming the readers in doing so. Just because a market for this content exists does not mean it is justified for publications to go absurd lengths to acquire information that they know the public will devour.\\n\\nAs a general rule, I think it is okay to report on celebrities' personal lives as long as the information being published comes from those celebrities themselves and are consensually disclosed by them only, where they are aware of the exposure that they're subjecting themselves to. When it comes to children, media organisations must be proactive in taking responsibility even if their celebrity parents aren't aware of the dangers that come with having a limelight at infancy.\\n\\nFollowing the scandal around Shakib Khan's marriage, our feeds and front doors got saturated with articles that are basically gossip written in formal language. It's all invasive, not only are they stepping on the civil liberties of these celebrities, but invading the lives of the general public as well. After a point these articles get harder and harder to avoid. Algorithms work their magic by pushing juicy articles to the top and suppressing genuine and informative journalism. The more likes and shares articles about Shakib Khan get, the more incentive media houses have to uncover never-seen-before information, and this deprave cycle continues.\\n\\nKoushin Unber wishes to fast-track winter in Dhaka.

To gasp and wince during a gross-out sequence is to have a giddy moment of connection with the people on the screen and in the cinema. All the barriers between us are dissolved by those sloshing bodily fluids. True, maybe we haven't all been sick on someone's head, used a washbasin as a toilet, or defecated in the street while wearing a designer wedding dress, as Melissa McCarthy and friends do in Bridesmaids (2011). But we all know that something like that could happen to any of us. Gross-out is a great leveller. \\\"A lot of comedy depends on the idea of superiority, and laughing at someone who\\u2019s inferior to you,\\\" says King. \\\"But in gross-out comedy, the characters are going through something that you could be going through yourself.\\\" The next time you're on a cruise liner, bear that in mind.\\n\\nTriangle of Sadness is out in US cinemas now and will open in UK cinemas on 28 October.\\n\\nLove film and TV?

She is a schoolteacher who falls for Tom (Styles), a policeman eager to broaden his cultural horizons. Together they form a friendship with Patrick (David Dawson), an aesthete who is a curator at the Brighton Museum of Art, forced by the era to hide his life as a gay man. As the triangle develops, Corrin beautifully establishes Marion's innocence, and then reveals it fading away.\\n\\nWhen another flashback gives us Patrick's perspective, we see that even while Tom is courting Marion in gentlemanly '50s fashion, he is beginning his affair with Patrick, an especially fraught move for a policeman at a time when homosexuality was illegal. When Tom makes the first move, grazing his finger along Patrick's neck, he seems startled and confused by his own gesture. Styles plays that initial confusion well, without any winks at the camera to evoke his off-screen persona. The sexual hesitation doesn't last long, although the deception all around does. The story soon revolves around questions of who knew what and when. How long is Marion truly, or maybe wilfully, blind?\\n\\nThe camera stays discreetly on Styles' face through that first sex scene. And a later scene between the men in bed is composed of graceful images of entwined bodies occasionally reflected in a mirror, the nudity never full-on or frontal. This is movie sex, not raw, messy real-life sex, and anyone wanting something more visceral really wants a different film.\\n\\nThe deepest flaw in My Policeman is that we grasp too little of the characters' inner lives. When Tom proposes to Marion in the apartment he has borrowed from Patrick, you have to wonder: what is he thinking? That's not a rhetorical question. What is he actually thinking? The screenplay by Ron Nyswaner (Philadelphia), based on Bethan Roberts' novel, could have explored much more from his perspective, young and older. Despite that, Styles evokes Tom's genuine, if selfish and callous, need to keep both his life with Marion and his lover. Roache is totally in sync as the older Tom, still charismatic and handsome, with an anger that suggests he remains in denial. McKee vividly shows Marion grappling with her memories. There is a long-buried betrayal and a guilty admission that are easy to see coming, but the plot is not the point, even when the period's homophobic laws come into play. The film works best at capturing the pain and occasional joy of the triangular arrangement.\\n\\nGrandage is still best known as a theatre director. His first film, Genius (2016), with Jude Law as the writer Tom Wolfe and Colin Firth as his editor, Maxwell Perkins, is also quiet and understated, which may be why it is underappreciated. My Policeman almost invites a similar fate. Unlike Style's off-screen persona, it is the opposite of explosive, but it is true to its director's eloquent vision.\\n\\n\\u2605\\u2605\\u2605\\u2606\\u2606\\n\\nMy Policeman opens in cinemas in the US and UK on 21 October, and will be available to stream on Amazon Prime from 4 November.\\n\\nLove film and TV?
